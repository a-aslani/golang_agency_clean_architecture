# Golang Agency back-end with the Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design concept

## What is Clean Architecture ?

Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern for designing software systems that aims to achieve separation of concerns and maintainability by keeping the codebase independent of any particular UI framework, database, or external service. It is based on the principles of "SOLID" and "DDD" (Domain-Driven Design).

The purpose of Clean Architecture is to create a software system that is easy to understand, maintain, and change over time. It accomplishes this by structuring the system into layers that enforce a clear separation of concerns, where each layer has a specific responsibility and dependencies only flow inwards.

The core idea of Clean Architecture is to establish a clear separation of concerns between the business logic, the application logic, and the infrastructure details. The business logic, which encapsulates the essential rules and behaviors of the system, should be independent of any implementation details, such as UI, database, or third-party services. This allows the business logic to be tested and developed independently from the infrastructure.
